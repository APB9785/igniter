# Igniter

**TODO: Add description**

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `igniter` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:igniter, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/igniter>.

# TODO list:

- [ ] properly parse args, not `"--dry-run" in argv`. Do we want to have some kind of "maybe parsed" args structure so we can call tasks with `argv` or one of those? Maybe.
